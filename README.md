# Sentiment Analysis on Heterologous Prime-Boost Covid-19 Vaccination in Thailand

In this project, we aims to do a sentiment analysis on heterologous prime-boost covid-19 vaccines on the Twitter platform due to the insufficient vaccines situation in Thailand.

We collected the dataset by ourself by using keywords and search on twiiter. The reason we do this is we can not collect too old data from Twitter by using Tweepy. The time that we started this project was different from the situation so we can not use data from Tweepy. This makes our dataset quite small.
